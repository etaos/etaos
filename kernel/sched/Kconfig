	bool "Scheduler"
	depends on CRT
	select TIMER
	select SYS_TICK
	help

	  scheduler is responsible for handeling the execution of
	  threads, virtual timers and, if available, SMP processors.

config EVENT_MUTEX
	bool "Event mutexes"
	select THREAD_QUEUE
	help
	  Enable to build more efficient mutexes, using
	  the scheduler to queue threads in a mutex. After
	  a signal has been given (from either IRQ or non-IRQ
	  context) the thread will be released into the run queue
	  again. If unsure say 'y' here.

config IPM
	bool "Inter-Process Messages"
	depends on EVENT_MUTEX
	help
	  Build support for IPM (Inter-Process Messages) if you say
	  'y' here. IPM can be used to communicate between different
	  threads which might also be running on another CPU.

config SCHED_DBG
	bool "Scheduling DBG"
	help
	  Say 'y' here to enable the scheduling debugger. This
	  function is only useful for ETAO/OS developers. If you
