menuconfig SCHED
	bool "Scheduler"
	depends on CRT
	select TIMER
	select SYS_TICK
	help
	  Say 'y' here if you want to enable the scheduler. The
	  scheduler is responsible for handeling the execution of
	  threads, virtual timers and, if available, SMP processors.
	  If you are unsure say 'n' here.

config RR
	bool "Round robin scheduler"
	select RR_SHARED
	select RR_ENTITY
	help
	  Say 'y' here to use the round robin algorithm to
	  schedule different threads.

config FIFO
	bool "FIFO scheduler"
	select RR_SHARED
	select RR_ENTITY
	help
	  Say 'y' here to use the FIFO scheduling algorithm to
	  schedule threads. The FIFO scheduler does not take
	  priorities into account when scheduling new threads.
	  The queue's are sorted with the time of insertion used
	  as the sorting key.

config LOTTERY
	bool "Lottery scheduler"
	select RR_SHARED
	select RR_ENTITY
	help
	  Say 'y'here to build the lottery scheduler. The lottery
	  scheduler depends on random number generation to pick
	  threads in a 'fair' way.

endmenu

config RR_SHARED
	bool
	help
	  Build the shared round robin helpers. These are automatically build
	  for all RR based algorithms.

config RR_ENTITY
	bool

choice
	prompt "Default algorithm"
	help
	  Select the default scheduling policy.

config SYS_RR
	bool "Round robin scheduler"
	depends on RR

config SYS_FIFO
	bool "FIFO scheduler"
	depends on FIFO

config SYS_LOTTERY
	bool "Lottery scheduler"
	depends on LOTTERY

config THREAD_QUEUE
	bool "Thread queues"
	select FIFO
	help
	  Enable support for thread queue's by saying 'y' here.
	  Thread queue's are a storage mechanism for threads using
	  the default scheduling policy as its storage mechanism.
	  You can select a storage mechanism (aka scheduling
	  algorithm) above.

config EVENT_MUTEX
	bool "Event mutexes"
	select THREAD_QUEUE
	help
	  Enable to build more efficient mutexes, using
	  the scheduler to queue threads in a mutex. After
	  a signal has been given (from either IRQ or non-IRQ
	  context) the thread will be released into the run queue
	  again. If unsure say 'y' here.

config IPM
	bool "Inter-Process Messages"
	depends on EVENT_MUTEX
	help
	  Build support for IPM (Inter-Process Messages) if you say
	  'y' here. IPM can be used to communicate between different
	  threads which might also be running on another CPU.

config DYN_PRIO
	bool "Dynamic priorities"
	depends on SYS_RR
	help
	  Say 'y' here to enable dynamic priorities. Dynamic
	  priorities are an extra set of priorites set by
	  the scheduler to make the scheduling process more fair
	  and reduce the chance that 2 high priority threads
	  dead swap the entire scheduling system. If you are
	  unsure say 'y' here.

config PREEMPT
	bool "CPU preemption"
	depends on SYS_RR
	help
	  Say 'y' here to enable preemption. Preemption allows
	  the scheduler to preempt the currently running task at
	  any given moment.

config TIME_SLICE
	int "Time slice"
	default 10
	depends on PREEMPT
	help
	  Configure the time slice of threads. The time slice defines
	  a period of time which threads have to execute a piece of
	  code. After that time has expired, the system will give another
	  thread CPU time.

config IDLE_SLEEP
	bool "Idle thread power saving"
	depends on ARCH_POWER_SAVE
	default y
	help
	  Say 'y' here to enter power saving mode when the idle thread
	  is executed. If you are unsure, say 'y' here; the only reason
	  to not say 'y' here is due to the slight performance loss from
	  having to wake up the CPU.

config SCHED_DBG
	bool "Scheduling DBG"
	help
	  Say 'y' here to enable the scheduling debugger. This
	  function is only useful for ETAO/OS developers. If you
	  are unsure say 'n' here.
