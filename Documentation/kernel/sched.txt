/**
 * @defgroup thread Thread management
 * @ingroup kernel
 * @brief Cooperative multi-threading support.
 * 
 * Typically ETA/OS is at its most useful where there are several concurrent 
 * tasks that need to be undertaken at the same time. To support this 
 * requirement, ETA/OS offers some kind of light processes called threads. 
 * In this context a thread is a sequence of executing software that can be
 * considered to be logically independent from other software that is running 
 * on the same CPU.
 *
 * The thread management API contains all functions which are used to
 * manipulate the state of the 'current' thread. The current thread is the
 * context of the thread calling the functions. Notable functions include
 * but not exclude yield(), sleep(), wait() and signal().

/**
 * @defgroup sched Scheduling core
 * @ingroup kernel
 * @brief ETA/OS scheduling support.
 *
 * @section sched-desc Introduction
 * The scheduler is responsible for handling the available CPU time, and
 * distributing it around the available threads. The entry point for the
 * scheduler is the function schedule(). This function will check two
 * value's before it decides to switch context or not. It checks the flag
 * THREAD_NEED_RESCHED_FLAG on the currently running thread, and it checks
 * if the thread selected by the algorithm as 'next' is not equal to the one
 * already running. To manually request a reschedule the following stepds are
 * required:
   @code{.c}
   struct thread *tp = current_thread();

   set_bit(THREAD_NEED_RESCHED_FLAG, &tp->flags);
   schedule();
   @endcode
 *
 * @section sched-other Responsibilities
 * The scheduler is responsible for of switching the context of threads, of
 * course. But there is bunch of other features it is updating:
 *
 * * checking if a thread has used up its time slice;
 * * signaling events which have been signaled from an IRQ;
 * * signaling IRQ threads for threaded IRQ support;
 * * updating the timers and clocksource of the CPU clocksource;
 * * Free-ing the memory of killed threads;
 * * Updating the dynamic priorities of threads in the run queue
 *
 * For this reason it is important that the scheduler gets called regularly.

/**
 * @defgroup preempt Preemption
 * @ingroup sched
 * @brief Preemption API
 *
 * Preemption is the act of (temporarily) interrupting a task to give other
 * tasks the chance at CPU time. How often the scheduler steps in with preemption
 * can be defined at compile time by changing the time slice.

/**
 * @defgroup edf Earliest Deadline First scheduler
 * @ingroup sched
 * @brief Documentation for the (virtual) earliest deadline first algorithm.
 *
 * @section principle Prinicple
 *
 * The earliest deadline first algorithm is a realtime scheduling algorithm
 * which uses deadlines (time) to determine the next thread to execute.
 * For ETA/OS it is (probably) not possible to archive hard realtime using EDF
 * because:
 *
 * * The scheduling clock is not precise enough
 * * It is extremely hard if not impossible to know before hand how long threads need to execute
 *
 * Therefore, it is a better solution to using virtual deadlines. This means
 * that there is no guarantee whatsoever that the thread will be executed by 
 * the time the deadline expires, it is merely used to select the next thread 
 * for execution.
 *
 * @section prios Priorities
 *
 * Priorities can be handled by using so called _priority_ _ratios_. A priority
 * is calculated using the nice value of a thread with the following formula:
 *
 * \f$f(p) = \frac{13p}{24} + 10\f$
 *
 * Where:
 * * p is the nice value of the thread
 *
 * The actual deadline can then be calculated using:
 *
 * \f$D = t + f(p)\f$
 *
 * Where:
 * * D is the deadline
 * * t is currently tick on the scheduling clock

/**
 * @defgroup lottery Lottery scheduler
 * @ingroup sched
 * @brief Probabilistic lottery scheduling.
 *
 * The lottery scheduling algorithm is a probabilistic scheduling algorithm.
 * Threads are assigned one or more lottery tickets, and the scheduler will
 * draw a random ticket to select a new thread for execution. The distribution
 * of tickets does not need to be uniform; granting a process more tickets
 * provides it a relative higher chance of execution. A user based priority is
 * transformed into a ticket number using the following function: \n
 * 
 * \f$f(x) = \frac{1}{25}x+10\f$ \n
 * where \f$x\f$ is the priority assigned by a user.
