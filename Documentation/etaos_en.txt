/**
 * @defgroup thread Thread management
 * @ingroup kernel
 * @brief Cooperative multi-threading support.
 * 
 * Typically ETA/OS is at its most useful where there are several concurrent 
 * tasks that need to be undertaken at the same time. To support this 
 * requirement, ETA/OS offers some kind of light processes called threads. 
 * In this context a thread is a sequence of executing software that can be
 * considered to be logically independent from other software that is running 
 * on the same CPU.

/**
 * @defgroup sched Scheduling core
 * @ingroup kernel
 * @brief ETA/OS scheduling support.
 *
 * @section sched-desc Introduction
 * The scheduler is responsible for handling the available CPU time, and
 * distributing it around the available threads. The entry point for the
 * scheduler is the function schedule(). This function will check two
 * value's before it decides to switch context or not. It checks the flag
 * THREAD_NEED_RESCHED_FLAG on the currently running thread, and it checks
 * if the thread selected by the algorithm as 'next' is not equal to the one
 * already running. To manually request a reschedule the following stepds are
 * required:
   @code{.c}
   struct thread *tp = current_thread();

   set_bit(THREAD_NEED_RESCHED_FLAG, &tp->flags);
   schedule();
   @endcode
 *
 * @section sched-other Responsibilities
 * The scheduler is responsible for of switching the context of threads, of
 * course. But there is bunch of other features it is updating:
 *
 * * checking if a thread has used up its time slice;
 * * signaling events which have been signaled from an IRQ;
 * * signaling IRQ threads for threaded IRQ support;
 * * updating the timers and clocksource of the CPU clocksource;
 * * Free-ing the memory of killed threads;
 * * Updating the dynamic priorities of threads in the run queue
 *
 * For this reason it is important that the scheduler gets called regularly.

/* ================ IRQ support ================ */

/**
 * @defgroup irq IRQ management
 * @ingroup kernel
 * @brief Interrupt support.
 *
 * Support to register interrupt handlers to the kernel. They can be registered
 * either as tradition IRQ handlers or as threaded IRQ's. Please note that
 * threaded IRQ's are slower.
 *
 * @note Note, that it is not required to register interrupts with Nut/OS. 
 *       Actually, this will route interrupts through the kernel, which 
 *       results in performance degradation.

/**
 * @defgroup irqchip IRQ chip management
 * @ingroup irq
 * @brief IRQ chip support.
 *
 * IRQ chips are the chips responsible for generating IRQ's. Examples of IRQ
 * chips are the CPU and on an x86 system the IOAPIC. IRQ's are registered
 * on an IRQ chip when they are allocated using the ETA/OS IRQ API. When an
 * interrupt is triggered, the IRQ chip is responsible for handling the
 * interrupt.

/**

 * handled in data structure of unused blocks of memory, the so called 
 * free-list.

 * 
 * @section usart-gen Generic description
 * A universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter, abbreviated UART, is a 
 * piece of computer hardware that translates data between parallel and serial 
 * forms. UARTs are commonly used in conjunction with communication standards 
 * such as EIA, RS-232, RS-422 or RS-485. The universal designation indicates 
 * that the data format and transmission speeds are configurable.
 *
 * @section usart-usage Usage
 * Writing or reading from a usart device is done as following:
 * @code{.c}
   int fd = open("dev-name", _FDEV_SETUP_RW);
   if(fd < 0)
   	error();
   write(fd, buff, length);
   read(fd, rxbuff, rxlen);
   close(fd);
